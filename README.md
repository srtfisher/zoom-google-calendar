# Zoom Google Calendar CLI Helper

Welcome to the Zoom Google Calendar CLI Helper!

This is a helpful CLI script that will pull in your calendar and open up the latest Zoom meeting URL. It will attempt to find events from the past ten minutes and the next hour (in case you're a little late or early). From there, it will find the Zoom URL and then open it (if you're on a Mac) in your browser.
